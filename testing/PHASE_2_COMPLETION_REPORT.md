### Critical Bug Fixes Achieved Through TDD

#### 1. **SQLite Thread Safety Crisis** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: InterfaceError during concurrent operations
**Root Cause**: Multiple threads accessing SQLite without proper locking
**TDD Solution**:
```python
# Added in simple_brain.py:_init_search_index()
import threading
self.conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
self._db_lock = threading.Lock()

# All database operations now wrapped with:
with self._db_lock:
    self.conn.execute(...)
```

#### 2. **File Corruption Prevention** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: JSONDecodeError when multiple sessions write simultaneously
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in working memory file writes
**TDD Solution**:
```python
# Added file locking in simple_brain.py:store()
import fcntl
with open(session_memory, 'w') as f:
    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
    try:
        json.dump(working_memory, f, indent=2)
    finally:
        fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
```

#### 3. **Session Persistence Architecture** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: Working memory not persisting across brain instances
**Root Cause**: Session directory not updating when session_id changed
**TDD Solution**:
```python
# Converted session_id to property with automatic directory management
@property
def session_id(self) -> str:
    return self._session_id

@session_id.setter
def session_id(self, value: str):
    self._session_id = value
    self._update_session_dir()
```

#### 4. **Basic Memory MCP Integration** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: UTF-8 encoding error preventing MCP operations
**Root Cause**: Windows-1252 encoded file with smart quotes (0x92 bytes)
**TDD Solution**:
```bash
# Fixed encoding in Obsidian notes affecting Basic Memory
iconv -f cp1252 -t utf-8 "/path/to/baml-brain-tests.md" > fixed.md
```
