# mvp/scripts

Utility scripts for local iteration:
- `regenerate_dashboard.py` – Manual rerun of analytics + dashboard without waiting for GH Actions.
- `seed_sample_data.py` – Populate `mvp/data/` with fixtures for testing the web UI.
- `dev_upload.py` – CLI helper mimicking iPhone Shortcut payloads.

Keep these optional; production runs rely on GitHub Actions.
