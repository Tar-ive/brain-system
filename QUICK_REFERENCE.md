# 🧠 Brain System - Quick Reference

## Morning Routine
```bash
bstart     # Loads context, shows goals, tells you what to focus on
```

## Throughout the Day

### When You Make Progress (ANY progress)
```bash
w "Fixed the bug"           # Log win, get dopamine hit
w "Read documentation"      # Small wins count!
w "Asked for help"         # Not quitting = win
```

### When You Hit a Problem
```bash
bl "Tests failing"         # Log blocker (DON'T QUIT!)
bh                        # Heal the system
ub                        # Mark as unblocked when fixed
w "Fixed it!"            # Celebrate the fix
```

### Memory Operations
```bash
c "Important insight"      # Capture thought
f "search term"           # Find memories
b                         # Check brain status
```

## If Something Breaks

### The Recovery Sequence
```bash
bh                        # Heal (fixes 90% of issues)
b                         # Check status
w "Recovered!"           # Log the recovery as a win
```

## Commands Cheat Sheet

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `bstart` | Start day | Every morning |
| `b` | Status check | When feeling lost |
| `w` | Log win | Made ANY progress |
| `bl` | Log blocker | Something broke |
| `bh` | Heal system | ANYTHING fails |
| `ub` | Unblock | Fixed a blocker |
| `c` | Capture | Important thought |
| `f` | Find | Need to recall |

## The Key Rule

**When something breaks:**
1. Don't abandon ❌
2. Log it: `bl "what broke"`
3. Heal it: `bh`
4. Fix it simply
5. Log win: `w "fixed it"`

## Your Commitment
> "I will NOT abandon the brain project when things break. I will simplify, not rebuild."

## Remember
- **Small wins count** - Even fixing typos
- **Commitment > Excitement** - Push through low motivation  
- **Simplify, don't rebuild** - When stuck, make it simpler
- **Every `w` = dopamine** - Celebrate everything!

---
**Stuck?** Run `bh` then `b` - fixes most issues
**Want to quit?** Run `bl "why"` - get anti-quit message
**Made progress?** Run `w "what"` - celebrate it!
