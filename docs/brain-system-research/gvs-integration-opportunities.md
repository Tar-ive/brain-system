    def __init__(self):
        self.brain_system = BrainSystem()
        self.gvs_controller = GVSStimulator()
        self.working_memory_monitor = WorkingMemoryTracker()

    def stimulate_working_memory(self, stimulation_pattern):
        # Apply GVS during working memory tasks
        gvs_effect = self.gvs_controller.apply_pattern(stimulation_pattern)
        memory_state = self.working_memory_monitor.get_current_state()
        return self.analyze_enhancement(gvs_effect, memory_state)

    def temporal_pattern_optimization(self):
        # Optimize stimulation timing based on cognitive load
        cognitive_load = self.brain_system.get_cognitive_load()

        cognitive_state = self.cognitive_monitor.get_state()
        gvs_pattern = self.optimize_for_creativity(cognitive_state)
        enhanced_thinking = self.gvs_system.apply_during_task(gvs_pattern, problem_complexity)
        return enhanced_thinking.solutions

    def spatial_reasoning_boost(self, spatial_task):
        # Enhance spatial reasoning during algorithm development
        baseline_performance = self.algorithm_engine.measure_performance(spatial_task)
        gvs_enhanced = self.apply_spatial_gvs_protocol(spatial_task)
        improvement_factor = gvs_enhanced.performance / baseline_performance
        return improvement_factor
```
