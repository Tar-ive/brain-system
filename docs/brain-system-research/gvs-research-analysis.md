# Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) - Comprehensive Research Analysis

## Executive Summary

Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique that applies weak electrical currents to the vestibular system in the inner ear. This research analysis explores GVS mechanisms, applications, and its potential connections to brain-computer interfaces, temporal processing, and neuroscience research.

## Overview and Basic Principles

### What is GVS?
Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a technique that uses electrical currents to stimulate the vestibular nerve endings in the inner ear. The vestibular system is responsible for balance and spatial orientation, and GVS can modulate its activity to produce various physiological and cognitive effects.

### Mechanism of Action
- **Electrical Stimulation**: Applies weak electrical currents (typically 0.5-5 mA) through electrodes placed on the mastoid processes
- **Nerve Activation**: Stimulates vestibular afferents that carry balance and spatial orientation information to the brain
- **Central Effects**: Influences brain activity and oscillations in connected brain regions
- **Physiological Response**: Creates sensations of movement, balance disruption, and spatial displacement

## Research Applications and Findings
