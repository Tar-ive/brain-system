**Your Personal Operating Manual for Maximum Efficiency**

## 🚀 The 3-Minute Daily Routine

```bash
# Every morning (takes 3 minutes)
bstart          # Shows goals, loads context, tells you what to focus on

# Throughout the day (instant)
w "any win"     # Log progress → dopamine hit
bl "any issue"  # Log problem → get help, don't quit
c "insight"     # Capture thought → saved forever

# End of day (optional)
bbackup         # Force backup to GitHub
```

---

## 🧠 Your Specific Use Cases

### When You're Excited About a New Idea
```bash
c "New idea: [describe it]"         # Capture immediately
w "Researched [topic]"               # Log the research as a win
```

### When Something Breaks (Your Weakness)
```bash
bl "What broke"                      # DON'T QUIT - log it
bh                                   # Try auto-heal
# If still broken:
bl "Still broken after heal"        # Document it
# Take a break, come back
ub                                   # Mark as unblocked when fixed
w "Fixed [what]!"                    # Celebrate!
```

### When Switching Between Projects
```bash
bs                                   # Save current context
# Work on other project
bstart                              # Restore context when back
```

### When You Need to Remember Something
```bash
c "Important: [thing to remember]"   # Instant capture
f "search term"                      # Find it later
```

## 💡 Efficiency Hacks

### The "Quick Win" Hack (When Motivation Low)
```bash
w "Opened the project"               # Counts!
w "Read one function"                # Counts!
w "Fixed a typo"                     # Counts!
# Small wins → momentum → big wins
```

### The "Anti-Abandonment" Protocol
```bash
# When you feel like quitting:
bl "Want to quit because [reason]"   # System talks you out of it
b                                    # See your commitment days
# You've already invested X days - don't waste them!
```

### The "Memory Overflow" Prevention
- Working memory: Max 7 items (cognitive limit)
- Old items auto-removed by importance
- Don't worry about losing things - everything in Obsidian

## 📊 What Gets Tracked Automatically

| What | Where | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Wins | GitHub + Obsidian | Every `w` command |
| Blockers | GitHub + Obsidian | Every `bl` command |
| Memories | ~/.brain/memory.log | Every `c` command |
| Context | working-memory/ | Continuously |
| Backups | GitHub | Every hour + on demand |

---

## 🔥 Your Behavioral Patterns (Observed)

1. **Pattern**: Get excited → Build complex → Something breaks → Abandon
   **Solution**: `bl` command prevents abandonment

2. **Pattern**: Forget to save/backup
   **Solution**: Auto-commits every hour

3. **Pattern**: Lose context when switching
   **Solution**: `bs` saves, `bstart` restores

4. **Pattern**: Overcomplicate systems
   **Solution**: 7-item limit, simple commands

## 🎮 Quick Command Reference

### Daily Use (Memory These)
```bash
w       # Win (any progress)
bl      # Blocker (any problem)
c       # Capture (any thought)
f       # Find (search)
b       # Brain status
```

### Maintenance (When Needed)
```bash
bh      # Heal system
bgit    # Check git status
bbackup # Force backup
bs      # Save session
bstart  # Load session
```

## 🏆 Gamification Elements

### Excitement Levels
- 🔥x10 = Maximum (new project)
- 🔥x7+ = Healthy
- 🔥x4-6 = Need wins
- 🔥x1-3 = Commitment mode (push through!)

### Daily Streaks
- Every `w` adds to streak
- Streaks = momentum
- Breaking streak is OK - just restart

### Blocker Badges (Mental)
- 🥉 Bronze: Fixed 1 blocker
- 🥈 Silver: Fixed 5 blockers
- 🥇 Gold: Fixed 10 blockers
- 💎 Diamond: Never quit despite blockers

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### "Everything is Broken"
```bash
bh                  # Heals 90% of issues
git status          # Check what changed
git stash          # Temporarily remove changes
bh                 # Try heal again
git stash pop      # Restore changes
```

### "Lost All Motivation"
```bash
b                   # See days committed
cat wins_log.json | grep WIN  # See all wins
w "Still here"      # Log persistence as win
```

### "Forgot How to Use"
```bash
cat QUICK_REFERENCE.md   # One-page guide
cat SAKSHAM_INDEX.md     # This file
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these weekly:
1. **Wins per day**: Aim for 3+
2. **Blockers resolved**: Each one = growth
3. **Days without abandonment**: Your record?
4. **Commits to GitHub**: Auto-tracked

---

## 🔮 Future Features Hook

When new features are added, they'll follow this pattern:
```bash
[verb][noun]  # Like: w=win, bl=blocker
```

New features will:
1. Be single letters or short
2. Follow existing patterns
3. Auto-backup to GitHub
4. Have `--help` option

Check for updates:
```bash
git pull              # Get latest features
./verify_setup.sh     # Verify everything works
```

## 💭 Philosophy Reminder

**Your Commitment**: "I will NOT abandon the brain project when things break. I will simplify, not rebuild."

**Why This Exists**: To break your pattern of abandonment and build lasting systems.

**The Core Truth**: Commitment > Excitement
